# Containers

Containers allow you to wrap all the software and its dependencies in an image, which can then run in any computing environment identically and reliably.  

They are essential for reproducible code because they document the versions of everything and allow you to run all analyses in isolation, separate from all other processes on a machine.  

There are two container types I'm aware of. Docker and Singularity. The former is the most common one. I've only encountered Singularity containers in HCPs that deal with PII or PHI and have higher privacy concerns.

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
