- Why is it called neuroecon? Quick historical tour.  
	- What is econ about it?  
	- What is neuro about it?  
	- What has it evolved to?  
	- Potentially problematic practices to keep in mind:  
		- Looking for neural correlates of folk terms  
		- Reverse inference  
		- Small sample sizes  
		- fMRI resolution  
- Value  
	- Simple choice (computationally and neurally)
	- Must the brain represent value? (Hayden and Niv, 2020)  
- Reinforcement learning
	- The success of the dopamine story 
- Usual suspects: Risk, ITC and self-control
	- Do we know how to measure "risk-taking" or "self-control"?  
	- What to make of lack of computational accounts like in simple choice or reinforcement learning?      
- Social decision making
- Network approaches (brand new/tentative)
