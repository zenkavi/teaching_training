- Building blocks. What is:  
	- Data  
		- Compare qualitative and quantitative data. How can you convert the former into latter to apply statistics on to it?
	- Model and parameters  
	- Probability  
	- Statistics  
	- Bayes Rule and its components  
		- In explaining how to compute marginal likelihoods/evidence/denominator could use Gronau et al. (2017) as a starting point for a tutorial 
- Common distributions  
	- Chapter 8 of Lambert textbook  
- Model fit and comparison  
	- Chapter 10 of Lambert textbook  
- Data and model fit visualizations   
- Simulation
- Example problems comparing (common) frequentist vs. Bayesian solutions 
	- Pearson correlation
	- Group difference (ANOVA)
	- Linear regression
