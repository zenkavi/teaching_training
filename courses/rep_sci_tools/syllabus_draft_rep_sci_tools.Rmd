Tools for replicable scientific research

- What is replication
	- Don't be scared of all the available tools
	- They've been developed by people whose job it is to make sure their products are reliable and transferable and who are trained as engineers to build such systems
	-	We don't tend to have such training. The point of this course is to familiarize ourselves with some of the tools and understand some design principles to build replicable analysis pipelines
	- Like most worthwhile things it takes some upfront investment and can seen tedious initially
- Containers
	- Docker and singularity
	- Getting into the practice of never running things locally
	- The least you should do to document requirements
- Using notebooks (R, Python, Matlab)  
	- Sharing notebooks with collaborators  
	- Writing papers in notebooks  
		- Makefiles
- Version control  
- Parallelized analyses
	- R and python examples
	- Grid search
	- Cross-validation

Optional:
- Pre-registration  
- Meta-analysis  
	- How to search for and save outputs  
- Data visualization
- Neuro specific - Poldrack et al. (2017), Nat Rev Neuro; Nichols et al. (2017), Nat Neuro
	- Neurodocker
